BIAF Analysis Module Initialization

This module serves as the entry point for various analytical functions within the BIAF framework.
It orchestrates the complex AI-driven data analysis processes and imports essential components
to facilitate seamless operation.

WARNING: Ensure to configure settings appropriately to avoid unexpected behavior during analysis.
